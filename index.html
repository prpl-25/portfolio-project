            <p>
                Hi, I'm Sindhu, a Computer Science student at Arizona State University, currently working toward my accelerated
                master's degree. I love solving problems, learning new things, and building tech that makes a real impact.

                I've had a chance to explore research and projects in reinforcement learning and machine learning. These along with internship, and teaching assistant experiences
                have helped shape my passion for tech and growth.

                Outside of work, I enjoy painting, hiking, photography, and taking long drives. I'm always looking for ways to grow -  whether that's through creative outlets,
                tackling unfamiliar challenges, or stepping outside my comfort zone. I believe in continuous learning and am always open to opportunities that push me forward in my career.
            </p>
